Churn is a good indicator of the growth potential for a company. Churn rate measures the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period.  
The impact of the churn rate is clear, so we need strategies to reduce it. Predicting churn is a good way to create proactive marketing campaigns targeted at the customers that are about to churn.  
The application allows users to predict churn for a single instance or a batch of observations. In the first case, the user will have to fill in the details given in the form and click on the Predict button to check if the customer is likely to Churn or not. In the second case, the user can upload a set of observations as a csv file and obtain predictions for each observation.
